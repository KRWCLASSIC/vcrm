# VCRM `Visual C++ Runtime Manager`

> For now project is left in unknown state, i don't remember what is happening there and why i used venv, i plan to remake it from ground up with one .py file, from little testing before pushing that readme looks like it _somehow_ works.

Based on work of [donno](https://github.com/donno)  
With help of [KemoNine's blog](https://blog.kemonine.info/blog/2024-11-07-windows-vc-redist/)

## Notes

When forcing to download older versions, its unable to unpack them. (Recommended to use with -nc)
To check all available arguments, use `--help` or `-h`

## Running `with GUI - using run.pyw`

Python 3.11.x needs to be installed systemwide (if not, change /python/pyvenv.cfg)
